_what to say about me? let's start from the top! Proud father of two sons (Ethan 2 and a half years old & Arthur 1 year old) and maried to a beautifull wife. I'm in a metal band, [RavenscaR](https://ravenscarband.bandcamp.com/releases), I do Streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/bel6team) and i love coding too! After this formation, my goal is to find a job ASAP in a nice start up or compagny._
